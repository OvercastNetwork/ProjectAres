/**
 * Captures aspects of a player's state that affect how they
 * are identified to other players. A player assumes a new
 * Identity whenever they change their nickname, or their
 * visibility (when we have /vanish). Two Identities are
 * equal if and only if they appear to be the same player
 * to all possible viewers.
 *
 * It should never be assumed that an {@link Identity} is the
 * player's *current* identity. The value of representing
 * identities with a concrete object is that they can be
 * stored and displayed even after the player who they belong
 * to has assumed a different identity.
 *
 * An {@link IdentityProvider} is used to create identities,
 * or to get the current identity of online players.
